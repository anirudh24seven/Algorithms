There are mainly 3 ways to solve recurrences:

1. Substitution method:
We make a guess for the solution and we use mathematical induction to prove that the guess is correct.

2. Recurrence Tree method:
We draw a recurrence tree and calculate the time taken by every level of tree. Finally, we sum the work done at all levels.
To draw the recurrence tree, we start from the given recurrence and keep drawing till we find a pattern among levels. The pattern is typically a arithmetic or geometric series.

3. Master method:
The master method is a direct way to get to the solution. This method works only for the following type of recurrences for for recurrences that can be transformed to the following type:

T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) where a >= 1 and b > 1

There are 3 following cases:
1. If f(n) = Theta (n^c) where c < (log a to the base b), then T(n) = Theta (n ^ (log a to the base b))
2. If f(n) = Theta (n^c) where c = (log a to the base b), then T(n) = Theta (n ^ c)
3. If f(n) = Theta (n^c) where c > (log a to the base b), then T(n) = Theta (f(n))
